Out with the old (as in: git history completely removed), in with the new!

use-package is all over the place now, be sure to create an elpa dir for it.

Initial startup can take some time as packages are fetched from melpa.

Things which still need help:
- python
- modeline (powerline? spaceline? hmm)
- magit
- ispell / flyspell
- tide (tern is working, but is useless for typescript)
